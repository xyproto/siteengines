Features and limitations

So far, there's:

* AJAX Chat
* A simple wiki
* An admin panel for the admin user
* A user registration system (with email and confirmation codes)
* A simple search function that also searches dynamic pages, (but does not search the wiki and chat yet)
* A few other engines that are incomplete
