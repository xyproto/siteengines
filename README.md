siteengines
===========

A collections of "engines" for the genericsite web framework for Go

So far, there's:

* AJAX Chat
* A simple wiki
* An admin panel for the admin user
* A user registration system (with email and confirmation codes)
* A simple search function that also searches dynamic pages, (but not the wiki and chat yet)
